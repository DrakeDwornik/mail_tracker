#**Passion Project:** Direct Mail Tracker
Direct Mail Tracker will use the USPS Informed Visibility data to truck direct mailing for coordinating multi-channel marketing efforts.

Data will come from two sources to produce the reports:

1. Automatically pulled from the USPS API
2. Manually uploaded mailing lists to separate mailings and associate destination addresses with tracking numbers

This application will allow small businesses to compete with larger companies that use mail management software with high up front capital costs. By having timing to mail to different regions multi-channel marketing campaigns can be times to maximize the number of impressions a customer receives in a tight time-frame. Additionally by having tracking for all mailings at no marginal cost a small business will be able to have a constant understanding of delivery times for various mail classes to various regions across the country as seasons change. This is information that clients often want to know when planning marketing campaigns and fund-raisers, by allowing small-businesses to have access to this data they will be better able to compete with larger providers.

I will be using Airflow, Postgres, and Django to implement the project

Minimum Viable Project will allow the uploading of scan data and job data to run reports.
